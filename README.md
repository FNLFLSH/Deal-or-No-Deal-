# Sprint Methodology — Project Development Summary

## Sprint Approach
Our group selected the **Sprint methodology** to structure and guide the development of our Deal or No Deal web application.  
We organized the project into a focused, time-boxed sprint with defined deliverables, role assignments, and collaborative checkpoints.

## Sprint Execution

### Collaboration and Workflow
The sprint began with task delegation based on individual team strengths. Each member worked on their assigned PHP components while maintaining a consistent coding structure. Class meeting times were used for integrating files, debugging interactions, and ensuring design consistency.

### Key Milestones
- Days 1–2: Core structure (index, game logic, sessions)  
- Days 3–4: Offer calculations, volatility logic, result page  
- Days 5: Additional features and market event integration  
- Day 6: File integration and UI refinement  
- Day 7: Planned testing and final adjustments
